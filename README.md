# PyBer Analysis Challenge

## Overview
V. Isualize has asked me and Omar to perform additional data analysis that will show a comparison of the PyBer ride-sharing data between Urban, Suburban, and Rural cities. This analysis includes a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each of those city types.

## Results

The results from the PyBer ride sharing data we analyzed shows that the type of city plays a role in total rides, total drives, total fares, and the average fare per driver and per ride.

The image below summarizes this data:

As you can see from the data above, the Urban area has the most rides and drives, and far more fare revenue than the Rural and Suburban areas. Because of the amount of drivers and the amount of rides that the Urban area has, PyBer is able to charge less per ride than the other areas.

The next step of our analysis was to create a multiple-line chart to provide a visualization of the weekly trends in Total Fares from the timeframe of January 2019 to April 2019.

This line chart shows the same general idea as the previous chart. The Urban area is bringing in significantly more revenue over time than the suburban and rural areas. The suburban area comes in second and the rural area comes in last.


## Summary

### Recommendations from Analysis

To address the disparity among the city types, here are a couple of suggestions. 
 
 1. Develop a strategy to get more riders and drivers in the suburban and rural areas.
     - This can be done by offering incentives to riders such as "First Time Ride is Free" or           "Frequent rider points" where a certain amount of points equals a free ride.
     - Give bonuses to drivers who are in the Urban area who assist in the Rural and Suburban          areas.
 2. Have better marketing strategies in the "underperforming" areas.
    - Partner with local businesses, send mailers, get more active on social media, etc.
    - Research events (concerts, shows, etc) that may be taking place in the different areas and go extra heavy on marketing during those times.
 3. Look at additional trend data that spans more than 4 months. We are only looking at a few months out of 2019. It is unclear from this data whether or not this is an improvement from previous years. If it is an improvement, what was done differently? If it is a decrease, then deeper analysis is required.
